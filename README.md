# Caffeine, Sleep, and Energy Survey Analysis

This project was completed for STAT 250 at Brigham Young University. It explores how daily caffeine use relates to average sleep hours and self-reported energy levels.  

## Project Overview
I surveyed over 70 participants to collect data on:
- **Sleep hours per night**
- **Daily caffeine use (Yes/No)**
- **Self-reported energy levels (1â€“10 scale)**  

The project includes a tidy dataset, R code for analysis and visualization, and a written report.

## Methods
- Two-sample **t-tests** comparing sleep hours and energy levels between caffeine users and non-users  
- **Boxplots** to visualize group differences  
- **Confidence intervals** to interpret uncertainty around the results  

## Results
- Adults who drank caffeine daily reported sleeping about **40 minutes less per night**, and this difference was statistically significant.  
- Energy levels were slightly lower among daily caffeine users, but the difference was **not statistically significant**.
